# rusty-lox

An implementation of the tree-walk interpreter from the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
book in Rust. The goal is to finish up the interpreter and end up with an implementation of the interpreter that
matches one to one in functionality with the Java version written in the book and passes all tests.

## Current Status

This project is currently unfinished, and is only implemented up to chapter 8. Around 40 out of the 60 tests of this
test pass at the moment - there are still some bugs (most likely relating to the console output of the program) that
need to be fixed before this interpreter will match the results of the Java version from the book itself.
